Dear ${([userInstance.title, userInstance.firstName, userInstance.lastName] - null).join(" ")},
<br/><br/>I am delighted to welcome you as a new user in the ESID Online Database for Primary Immunodeficiencies!
<br/><br/>This is your user name:
<br/><br/><b>${userInstance.username}</b>
<br/><br/>You will receive the password to access the database for this user name by post within the next few days.
<br/><br/><b>User Manual</b><br/>
Please follow the link below to download our user manual which will help you getting familiar with the database:
<br/><a href='http://esid.org/content/download/13393/379322/file/NewESIDregistry_user_manual.pdf'>Download pdf</a>
<br/><br/><b>Password</b><br/>
Once you enter the registry, you will be prompted to set a new password: enter the password you receive from us and then your own, new password. The new password has to consist of a minimum of 6 characters and has to contain
<br>1 upper case letter (A, B, C...)
<br>1 lower case letter (a, b, c...)
<br>1 digit (1,2,3...)
<br>1 special character of this list: +-_,:;=?!#
<br>Example for a valid password: Wd1lmcf?
<br/><br/><b>Web address</b><br/>
You can access the ESID Main Registry under following URL:
<br/><a href=https://cci-a1.ukl.uni-freiburg.de/EERS>Link to ESID Registry</a>
<br/><br/><b>Patient IDs</b><br/>
Please note that the patient identification number for each new patient is randomly selected by the database. Please record this ID in a center specific list indicating which ID number matches which patient name. It is the responsibility of the center to maintain this assignment list and to keep it securely locked. LOST ASSIGNMENT TABLES CANNOT BE RECOVERED BY THE ESID DATABASE!

If you use the personalised version of the database, patient names are stored on a separate server and shown in the web interface. Therefore, keeping an independent assignment table is optional, but recommended.
<br/><br/>Please also read the attached data protection tutorial.
<br/><br/>Best regards and hopefully much pleasure in working with the ESID Online Database!
<br/><br/>The ESID Online Database Team<br/><br/>
